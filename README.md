# Portfolio

A personal portfolio rebuilt from an older version with a brutalist, industrial-grunge zine aesthetic.

## Design
- Updated from a previous portfolio to better reflect a bold, tactile identity.
- Gallery layout inspired by Bizarrap's site, mixed with animated sci-fi and cyberpunk cues.
- High-contrast typography and layered textures to keep the interface raw and intentional.

## Tech Choices
- **Angular (standalone + signals)** for structured, scalable UI composition.
- **Tailwind v4 with `@apply`** to keep templates clean and styles centralized.
- **Reactive Forms** for the contact section.
- **NgOptimizedImage** for performant media handling.
- **Font Awesome** for social icon consistency.

## Structure
- `src/app/core` for global layout and services.
- `src/app/features` for page sections (hero, about, projects, contact).
- `src/app/shared` for reusable UI and helpers.
- `docs/` for project context and changelog.

## Status
- In progress.
